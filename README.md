# Stock Recording System â€“ COCOMO II Based Software Cost Estimation

## Overview
This project presents a detailed cost and effort estimation for a **Stock Recording System (SRS)**, developed as part of the **CSE 5325: Project Management** course (Fall 2024). The SRS is designed to be a user-friendly and secure platform for managing stock trading activities across both web and Android applications.

The estimation follows the **COCOMO II (Constructive Cost Model)** framework and includes detailed analysis of scale drivers, cost drivers, and resource allocations. This repository provides insights into real-world software estimation using industry-standard models.

## Project Objectives
- Develop a platform to record and manage stock trades
- Offer real-time updates for watchlists and transactions
- Calculate capital gains/losses with notification features
- Enable access via web and Android applications

---

## ðŸ”§ Estimation Methodology
The estimation is conducted using the **COCOMO II** model and includes:
- **Source Lines of Code (SLOC)**: ~5,000
- **5 Scale Drivers**: Precedentedness, Flexibility, Risk Resolution, Team Cohesion, Process Maturity
- **17 Cost Drivers**: Covering personnel, platform, product, and project attributes

Tools used:
- **System Star Tool** for effort estimation and schedule planning
